# SQL: Employee Tracker

## Your Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. My goal is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application allows enables the user to track employee details, roles and departments from the command line. It stores data on an sql server.  


## User Story

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Usage
